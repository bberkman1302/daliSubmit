## Gini Visualization
![image info](Gini.png)

The GINI coefficient is a value used to measure income inequality within a certain group, often countries. Here, I visualize that coefficient for each country using a world map. I choose to represent the range of GINI coefficients for each country using a red gradient, with countries on the lower end of the spectrum more white and countries on the higher end of the spectrum a darker red. I made the decision to use a red gradient to represent this range given that the color red is often associated with negative traits, so the audience would be more likely to understand that countries on the darker end of the spectrum have higher rates of inequality even if they are unfamiliar what the GINI coefficient actually calculates. 

When filtering the data, I decided to only use points from 2000-2017, and that paints the most accurate picture of the current status of inequality globally. Additionally, I choose to only include data points with an “areacovr” value of “all,” as most datapoints fell under that category thus I was able to avoid including duplicates that did not include all land areas.
